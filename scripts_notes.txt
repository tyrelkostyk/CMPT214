SCRIPTS
------------------------------------------

'#!<interpreter>' at the START of a file specifies the start of a script

'#!/bin/sh' - shell script
'#!/bin/bash' - bash script

Comments start with '#' in scripts

sh is a slightly restricted version of bash

Variable Expansion: ${var_name} ; think $HOME, etc
predefined vars: ? = exit status of last command
                 $ = PID of current process
                 # = num of arguments (doesn't count command/script itself)
                        - 1 less than argc
                 @ = expands to all parameters

user-defined Variables: VARNAME=value

put 'set -x' anywhere in your script to beginning output what's executed
    -v for verbose; just prints what's read (every line)

Scripts spin up child processes to complete their commands

Changes that a child process makes to env vars are unknown to parent processes

running a shell script runs a child process of the shell script you are using(?)
